# The sprint document

The planning ceremony's terminal artifact, defined once. The ceremony's
ok-planner surface references this file; nothing restates it inline.

`{{SPRINT-DOCUMENT-TEMPLATE}}` is the whole document. Its **How to
execute this sprint** and **Completion contract** sections are fixed
boilerplate — copied verbatim into every sprint, never paraphrased and
never trimmed. Together they make the sprint self-driving: the how
frames the executor's approach, the contract is the stop condition, and
`/certify-work` discharges the contract. That is what lets a sprint be
handed directly to `/goal`, to an orchestrator, or picked up inline —
every executor works from the same brief.

### {{SPRINT-DOCUMENT-TEMPLATE}}

```markdown
# Sprint: <title>

## Intent

<What this sprint is for, in a few sentences. A sprint with no single
theme says so plainly — do not invent one. List the ids of the issues
promoted into this sprint, if any.>

## Corpus deltas

<The substantive body, authored per {{CORPUS-DELTA-FORM}} in
`artifact-definitions.md`. Each delta sits under a heading naming the
operation and target:>

### New story: <slug>
### Amend concept: <slug>
### Retire decision: <slug>

<Every delta is a complete FINAL-FORM body, resolved during planning:
new artifacts and amendments carry the whole file content; a
retirement carries nothing beyond its heading. A sprint with large
bodies carries them in the sidecar folder beside this file
(`<sprint-name>-deltas/<kind>s/<slug>.md`), the heading pointing
there. No delta carries a diff, a base pin, or a derivation.>

## Work items

<The implementation units that realize the deltas — a flat, unordered
list. Each names the stories/decisions it makes true (by slug) and
describes the outcome, not the method. Real dependencies between items
are stated as such; do NOT group items into stages, phases, or themes,
and do not impose an order that is merely tidy. Sequencing is the
executor's job.>

## How to execute this sprint

This sprint is self-sufficient. Whoever executes it — an inline
working session, an agent this file is handed to via the native
`goal` mechanism, or an orchestrator that does its own planning —
proceeds the same way.

1. Read the sprint whole first — intent, deltas, work items,
   completion contract — before touching anything. Do not go looking
   for context behind it (not in the issue intake under
   `.ok-planner/issues/`, not in `history/`). The sprint is
   self-sufficient by construction; a genuine gap is raised with the
   owner, never filled by inference.

2. Stage the work. The items above are a flat, unordered list;
   group them by theme, file surface, or dependency, and order the
   groups so nothing is built on something not yet there. Write the
   staged list as the opening section of the completion report
   (step 8) before you build anything: `## Stages`, one line per
   stage, each marked pending. Seed the closing stages up front —
   finish the completion report, run `/certify-work` with this
   sprint's path as its argument, walk the presentation, offer
   archive-and-commit — so the ceremony is a standing pending line
   from the first minute, not a memory to retain past a long run.
   Mark each stage done as it lands. The list lives in the report
   and nowhere else — not in a harness task tool, and never
   rewritten into a plan document: this sprint is the whole brief.
   An orchestrator uses its own graph and still records the stages
   in the report, so the record is whole.

3. Apply each corpus delta as part of the work that realizes it —
   copy the final-form body into `.ok-planner/design/` verbatim
   (from the sidecar where the heading points there), or delete the
   file for a retirement. A delta no work item implements (a
   clarification, a retirement) is applied on its own.

4. Build stage by stage. Every new or amended story whose substance
   is implemented in code is exercised end-to-end by a test in the
   project's ordinary suites, carrying the `@story:` annotation for
   navigation — that annotation is also how the periodic audit finds
   the test later. No test ever checks the existence of static text,
   code, or prose: a commitment realized in prose carries no test.
   Write the tests with the work, not at the end.

5. Completeness is the floor. Never stub, defer, narrow, no-op, or
   leave a `TODO` in place of a promised outcome. A capability the
   deltas or work items promise is delivered in full, or the blocker
   that prevents it is surfaced — never silently dropped.

6. Never destroy uncommitted work. Stage progress as each stage
   finishes (`git add -A`) so a stray revert cannot reach it. Do not
   run `git checkout`/`restore`/`reset`/`stash`/`clean` on your own
   initiative; fix a bad edit forward by editing again.

7. Work unsupervised to a defensible done — no pausing for approval,
   confirmation, or progress checks. Stop only on a genuine blocker:
   a credential or access that cannot be obtained, a step literally
   impossible in the current state, a destructive/irreversible
   action not clearly authorized — or the closing `/certify-work`
   step being unrunnable for you (e.g. its subagent dispatches are
   unavailable): surface that and stop; never skip the ceremony and
   call the work done. Ambiguity is not a blocker — pick the most
   plausible reading and continue, surfacing the choice at the end.
   (An orchestrator that supervises its own executors folds this into
   its own control.)

8. Keep the completion report current. Beside this sprint file lives
   its report — same filename with `-completion` before the
   extension — and you write it as you go: open it in step 2 with
   the staged list; as each stage lands, mark it done and record
   what was done, every divergence, and every call you made where
   the sprint was silent. It is the durable record the closing
   ceremony finishes and walks with the owner, the artifact a goal
   checker requires, and it is archived together with this sprint.
   It is a record of this execution, never a plan document.

9. Close by running `/certify-work` with this sprint's path as its
   argument — the argument is what puts the sprint in the gate's
   scope; the gate never adopts one on its own. It brings the work into
   alignment with this sprint and discharges the completion contract
   below at the change's own scope, across every estate this project
   has: the project's own test suites over the touched work,
   change-scoped corpus checks over the touched artifacts and
   annotations, code review over the diff —
   all producers feeding a no-discretion review-fix loop (a fixer
   fixes everything a reasonable owner would wave through; an
   architect adversarially checks its kickbacks, fixing the refuted
   and promoting only genuine intent forks to the issue intake),
   and the outcomes and divergences are presented to the owner.
   (Whether the corpus's claims still hold is the periodic `/audit`
   run, on the owner's cadence, never this close.) `/certify-work`
   ends the run. It writes its composed presentation into the
   completion report, finishing the record kept in step 8. It walks
   that presentation with the owner. It offers the close-out. The run
   stops there.

**After the run stops.** The owner archives this sprint. The owner
commits the work. The run does neither on its own initiative. It
offers both at the end of the presentation and stops. Until the owner
answers, this file stays at its `sprints/` path. When the owner
answers yes, the run moves this file, its completion report, its
delta sidecar, and the issue files it resolved to `history/`. Then it
commits the work. Then it stamps the archived sprint with the closing
commit — `closed: <sha>` in the frontmatter, one small follow-on
commit. The next planning ceremony reads that stamp to detect work
done out of band. The words "finish the sprint" are not a yes. Nor is
"follow the boilerplate". Both ask the run for the presentation.

## Completion contract

The work is not done until all of the following hold, each
verifiable from the repository as it stands:

1. The design corpus matches every delta above (applied verbatim,
   from the sidecar where a heading points there).
2. The project's own test suites pass, and every new or touched
   story implemented in code is exercised end-to-end by a test the
   suites run.
3. The completion report beside this sprint (same filename with
   `-completion`) is finished: it records the work done and the
   divergences, and carries `/certify-work`'s presentation — the
   review-fix loop run last and come back clean, every finding
   fixed or promoted-and-verified.

**The goal rule, for any checker verifying this contract.** The goal
is met when items 1–3 all verify against the repository. Read the
repository as it stands to decide. Never decide from the session
transcript. An earlier session may have done this work, and a term
the transcript does not show may still hold on disk. That state
IS the goal met — do not require more: walking the presentation,
archiving, committing, and the `closed:` stamp all FOLLOW
completion, and a pending archive-and-commit offer is evidence the
goal is met, never that work remains. Where this sprint file sits is
no term of the rule: `sprints/` and `.ok-planner/history/sprints/`
satisfy it alike, and a sprint already archived bearing a `closed:`
stamp is terminal — stop checking, whatever else seems unfinished. A
missing completion report means NOT done, however green the rest
looks. Distinct from every state above: a run parked at the
review-fix loop's cycle cap awaiting the owner's direction has not
met the goal — a legal in-flight state, not done, not failed, and
never grounds for the run to take either cap step itself. Nothing
else counts either way.
