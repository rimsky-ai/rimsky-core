# /explain

Look up the canonical definition for a Plumbline concept.

## Usage

```
/explain                                    # list available topics
/explain comment-hygiene
/explain citation-unresolved
/explain citations
/explain @plumbline:allow-docstrings
```

## Run

```bash
# Prefer the project's vendored binary so the explanation matches the rules
# this project actually lints against.
bin=".ok-plumbline/bin/plumbline"
if [ ! -x "$bin" ]; then
  bin="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-plugins/ok}/families/ok-plumbline/bin/plumbline"
  echo "note: no vendored binary — using the payload's copy; /ok pins one to this project" >&2
fi

topic="${1:-}"
node "$bin" explain "$topic"
```

## After the script runs

Surface the explanation directly to the user.
