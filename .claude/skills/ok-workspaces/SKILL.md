## What ok-workspaces is

Workspace hygiene for parallel agent work, as three rules that travel together — **one worktree per job**, **one isolated runtime stack per worktree**, **content-addressed artifacts** (never a mutable tag in a verification path). The rules are stack-invariant; their realization is tailored by the project's committed stack profile at `.ok-workspaces/config.json` (detection proposes, the committed file decides). The always-in-context rules live in `.claude/rules/ok-workspaces-cheatsheet.md`, materialized from the profile.

## The verbs

Each row below is single-sourced from that skill's own frontmatter description — a repo maintenance check asserts row-description agreement, so a change starts at the description and the row follows. Read the skill body itself before running one. Invoke by slash command, or via the Skill tool (`ok-workspaces:<name>` from the installed plugin; the materialized name in a vendored project).

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `/ok-workspaces-audit` | Read-only compliance sweep of the discipline's mechanical rules — mutable tags in verification paths, unparameterized runtime isolation, worktree naming, src-tag consumption; reports findings with evidence and fixes nothing. |
| `/open` | Creates one job's isolated workspace: a worktree on its own branch per the profile's naming, ephemeral local config carried over, and the namespaced runtime provisioned. |
| `/close` | Safety-gated teardown of a job's workspace: refuses on uncommitted work or an unmerged branch, then stops the runtime, removes the worktree, and deletes the branch. |

## The estate

- `.ok-workspaces/config.json` — the committed, authoritative stack profile. The discovery marker `/ok` keys on.
- `.ok-workspaces/bin/src-tag` (path profile-configurable) — the canonical content-addressed tag script: prints `src-<12 hex>`, a git tree-object hash of the working tree including uncommitted changes. Byte-identical across every consumer so cooperating tools always agree on the tag.
- `.ok-workspaces/worktrees/` — where job worktrees live by default, inside the project root so nothing escapes it. Checkouts, not repo content: `.ok-workspaces/.gitignore` (suite-owned, written on converge) keeps them untracked. A project may point `worktrees.dirPrefix` elsewhere; the committed profile decides.
- `.claude/rules/ok-workspaces-cheatsheet.md` — the always-in-context rules, rendered from the profile, wholly plugin-owned.
