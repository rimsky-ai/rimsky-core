name: audit
description: "ONLY activated by explicit /audit slash command, or run by /document as its measurement front. Never auto-triggered by conversation content. The suite's periodic audit, covering every estate this project has: opens by settling the public-surface partition with the owner where anything is unsettled (its one interactive moment), measures story support from the user's side through the ruled public surface on the maintained experiment harness, re-reads decisions and concepts against the codebase, hands everything it could not call supported to a second-opinion judge, then commits the audit corpora and stamps the commit. Two determination stages, no loop; run on the owner's cadence, never per sprint."

# Audit (the periodic run)

The audit runs on the owner's cadence, not at every close. Certification
does not touch audits at all: `/certify-work` runs the tests, the
alignment producers, and code review, and says nothing about whether a
corpus's claims still hold. This verb is where that question gets asked,
over every corpus the project has, and answered. It is also the
documentation ceremony's entire measurement front: `/document` opens by
ensuring a current audit and consumes its determinations rather than
re-measuring.

This is a **suite verb**, not any one family's. One canonical body
covers whichever skill families the project integrates, and which those
are is read from the filesystem when the verb runs — never fixed when
it was vendored.

The run makes three determinations, in order:

1. **The surface** — where an estate's surface declares a
   public-surface partition, settle it: enumerate, classify by the
   owner's guidance, walk what the guidance cannot settle, write the
   stamped ruling. This is the run's **one interactive moment**, and a
   settled partition passes it silently.
2. **Story support, from the user's side** — each story verified by
   driving the released product through the ruled public surface on
   the maintained experiment harness, per its estate's protocol.
3. **Decision and concept support, from the technical side** — an
   adversarial reading of each claim against the code as it stands.

Then one **judge** over everything the determinations could not call
`supported`, and the run ends. There is no fix loop, no re-audit, and
no third determination stage. The judge's third outcome is filing an
issue, so nothing can come back for another pass. What the run leaves
behind is a corpus of current determinations, a surface ruling, a
maintained harness, a commit that names itself, and — where gaps are
real — issues in the intake for the owner to rule on.

## The two axes

Every determination answers two independent questions about one
artifact: **does it comply with its own authoring rules?** and **does
the codebase support what it claims, at this commit?** Both are
recorded, because they genuinely come apart — a malformed artifact may
be accurately implemented, and a well-formed one may be implemented
nowhere. Only the support axis escalates to the judge; a compliance
defect is mechanical by construction, so it is recorded and reported
for whoever holds the report to fix.

The support instrument differs by what the artifact claims. A story
promises a user outcome, which reading can only infer — so its
instrument is measurement through the public surface, and it is never
settled by reading or by citing a test. A decision or concept
describes internals no user-vantage run can see — so its instrument is
the adversarial reading. The same three words, the same collection,
the same escalation, a different instrument.

The canonical shape is `{{AUDIT-DEFINITION}}` and
`{{AUDIT-FILE-FORMAT}}` in `../_shared/artifact-definitions.md`. No
citations, no hashes, no line numbers. Every universal an artifact
claims comes back as a count plus the population it was taken from,
because that is the one form of precision a reader can refute in
seconds. Asking whether an audit still holds is a git question — how
far HEAD has moved since the commit it names — not a computation.

## Resolve the estates

Every family's presence is a filesystem check at the project root —
the nearest ancestor of the working directory (itself included)
holding an estate directory, never derived from `.git` and never an
inference:

| estate | family |
|---|---|
| `.ok-planner/` | ok-planner |
| `.ok-plumbline/` | ok-plumbline |
| `.ok-workspaces/` | ok-workspaces |

For each estate present, read `<estate>/ceremony/audit.md` — the
family's **ceremony surface**. That file, not this one, says which
collection the family exposes, how its determinations are shaped,
whether and how it rules a surface partition, and what else it checks;
this body never carries family-specific instructions and never
improvises them. A surface that is missing where its estate exists is
a conformance defect: report it and carry on with the rest.

No estate at all → say so and stop; there is nothing to audit.

**`.ok-planner/` is required for this verb.** The audit definition and
file format this body transcludes, the auditor and judge prompts, the
issue-file format the judge files by, and the `audit-check` binary the
Check phase runs are all vendored or materialized by the planner
estate's converge. Without it, say so and stop — a run that cannot
record a determination or file a confirmed gap is not an audit.

Tell the owner which estates are in scope, and how many artifacts each
contributes, before dispatching anything.

## The spine

1. **Layout** — each family ensures its own directories exist. Estate
   convergence is the front door's administration (`/ok`), never this
   run's.
2. **Resolve the subject.** The run audits the project as it stands.
   Read `git status`; if the tree is dirty, say so in one line and
   audit the working tree as it is — the audits name the commit they
   are recorded in, which is the honest anchor either way.
3. **Surface** — each surface that declares a surface determination
   runs it now, per its own instructions: enumerate by the declared
   sources, diff against the last ruling's extraction, ratify guidance
   changes, classify, walk what the guidance cannot settle with the
   owner, write the stamped ruling. This is the run's one interactive
   moment, front-loaded because every downstream determination depends
   on the partition; a settled partition and ratified guidance pass it
   silently, so cadence runs stay hands-free.
4. **Enumerate** — each surface names its live artifacts and how to
   batch them, by instrument. Group reading batches by locality so
   artifacts whose claims rest on the same code ride in one dispatch
   and that code is read once; group measurement batches by the
   surface elements they drive.
5. **Determine** — dispatch the auditors in parallel, one per batch,
   per each surface's instructions — measurement batches on the
   estate's experiment harness, reading batches against the code.
   Never one agent per artifact, and never a subagent inside an
   auditor.
6. **Judge** — collect every escalation from every estate and dispatch
   **one** judge over the lot. One judge per run, not one per family:
   its independence is what the stage buys, and splitting it by estate
   buys nothing and costs a read.
7. **Distill** — each surface's promotion-candidate filing: the
   experiments this run had to build, passing at the stamp, that would
   have to be maintained to keep. Never a failed run, never an opinion
   of the product.
8. **Sweep** — the whole-corpus passes each surface declares. These
   report findings in-context; they write no determination and file
   nothing.
9. **Check** — the mechanical floor. Run the vendored audit checker,
   which validates every estate's audit files — and the surface ruling
   where one exists — in one pass. A finding means the judge or the
   surface determination left something unfinished; re-dispatch that
   stage for those refs rather than editing a record by hand.
10. **Verify** — if the judge or the distillation filed any issues,
    each surface's post-filing step makes them ruling-ready. Zero
    filings → skip, silently.
11. **Present** — the report below.
12. **Close-out** — commit, then stamp.

## The presentation

Compose it in full — it is a report, so it is delivered whole rather
than paced:

```
# Audit — <project> at <short sha or "working tree">

Estates: <the ones in scope, and the artifact count each contributed>

<Then, per estate, the section its ceremony surface defines.>

## Issues filed
<Every issue this run created, by path, with the verify pass's outcome
per issue: answered by the corpus and closed with the citation, or
verified and awaiting the owner's ruling. These are the next planning
ceremony's business, not this run's.>
```

## The close-out

The run commits its own output — that is what makes an audit a
statement about a commit rather than about a moment. Two commits, both
this verb's own act, covering every estate's audits together:

1. Commit the audit corpora, each estate's surface ruling and
   extraction, the opening walk's transcriptions into that estate's
   surface inputs, the experiment harnesses' changes, and any issue
   files, with a message naming the run and its counts.
2. Stamp that commit's short sha into every audit's `commit:` field —
   and into each ruling's commit anchor — and make one small follow-on
   commit. Each record then names the commit whose tree holds both the
   code it describes and the record itself.

**The staleness rule consumers key on.** The audit is current for a
later tree exactly when the diff from its stamped commit touches only
the run's own output paths — the audit corpora, the rulings and
extractions, the experiment harnesses, the issues it filed, and the
opening walk's transcriptions into each estate's surface inputs, as
that estate's surface enumerates them. A path-scoped diff, no tracked
state. This is
how `/document` (and an owner running audit-then-document) avoids
paying the measurement twice: the audit's own committed outputs move
the tree, but the diff shows that nothing the audit measured changed.

Archive nothing and offer nothing else: this run has no sprint, and the
issues it filed stay in the intake until a planning ceremony closes
them.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does not carry family knowledge. Everything family-specific comes
  from the ceremony surfaces in the estates present, and nothing else.
- Does not fix anything. A real gap becomes an issue for the owner to
  rule on and a sprint to close; a form defect is recorded and
  reported. There is no fixer, no architect, and no cycle cap, because
  there is no loop.
- Does not run the project's test suites or build it; whether they
  pass is `/certify-work`'s business. The story instrument does
  execute the released product — only through elements the ruling
  classifies public, per each estate's protocol.
- Does not compute staleness, maintain a re-audit set, or track what
  changed. Every artifact is read every run; every experiment re-runs
  at this tree. The path-scoped currency rule is a question a consumer
  asks of git, not state this run maintains.
- Does not edit any corpus. The corpora's claims are the subject under
  audit, never the thing edited to make an audit pass.
- Does not read project records — sprints, sketches, history. Those are
  out of context.
- Does not ask the owner anything past the opening surface walk — the
  run's one interactive moment. After it, the run audits, judges,
  files, presents, and commits.
- Does not converge an estate, materialize a file, or repair a family's
  presence. That is `/ok`, always a user action.
