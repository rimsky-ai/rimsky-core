# ok-planner Cheatsheet

Materialized by ok-planner v6.0.0. Plugin-owned: overwritten
wholesale by `/true-up`; project-specific rules belong in your own files under
`.claude/rules/`.

The planner's estate lives in `.ok-planner/` (its embedded `CLAUDE.md` carries
the full per-directory rules). The short version every session needs:

## The three content kinds

- **`design/` — source of truth, read freely.** Concepts, stories, decisions:
  the project's durable model, same weight as code. Changed only by applying
  an approved sprint backlog's corpus deltas — never ad hoc. Code cites it via
  `@concept:` / `@story:` / `@decision:` annotations.
- **`issues.jsonl` — the intake queue.** Append-only JSONL event log of
  questions awaiting the owner's judgment; an issue's state is the fold of its
  rows by id. Anyone may append `open` rows; only a `/sprint` session ends
  one, by **promoting** it into that sprint's backlog (row marked with the
  backlog's name) or **retiring** it. Never edit or delete rows.
- **`backlogs/`, `sketches/`, `history/` — records, out of context by
  default.** Do not read them to understand the project, do not include them
  in general exploration, do not reconcile them with current code. A backlog
  is in context while you are executing it, not otherwise; `sketches/` is
  speculative future thinking (written by `/sketch`); `history/` is the
  archive — same-named folder per artifact kind, preserved indefinitely.
  Touch records only when the user or an ok-planner skill directs it.

## Lifecycle

`/sketch` captures an idea in `sketches/` (no authorization to build).
`/sprint` produces a sprint backlog in `backlogs/` — corpus deltas + work
items + a fixed completion contract — resolving with the owner the open issues
that bear on that work and promoting them into it. Executing the backlog is an
ordinary working session (or an orchestrator's job — same contract either
way): stage the work items yourself, apply the deltas to `design/`, build,
`/prove` every touched story and decision, and finish with `/audit`, whose
judgment findings land back in `issues.jsonl`. The full execution shape is in
`.ok-planner/CLAUDE.md`. On completion, artifacts move to their same-named
folder under `history/`.

## Hard rules

- A sprint backlog is a backlog: disparate items, no theme, no order. Staging
  it is execution's job — never write a plan document from one.
- The backlog is the source of truth for its work. A promoted issue is settled;
  never read the queue to find out what a backlog "really meant".
- Open issues gate the work they bear on, not all work; the rest stay queued.
- Design docs are current-state only: no changelogs, no roadmaps, no TODOs.
- Nothing in the suite runs true-up from a hook; it is always a user action.
