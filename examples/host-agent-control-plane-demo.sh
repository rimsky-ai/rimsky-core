# @story: host-agent-control-plane — runnable proof.
#
# An operator running rimsky-dispatched workflows on a dev machine manages
# the host-agent's lifecycle from the same CLI that drives the rimsky
# stack: `rimsky agent start` brings the daemon up against a configured
# proxy, `rimsky agent status` reports the connection state, and `rimsky
# agent stop` brings it down cleanly (children reaped, no zombies).
#
# The script exercises three load-bearing properties named in the story's
# Falsifier:
#
#   1. `start` REFUSES with a clear diagnostic on a misconfigured proxy
#      URL — it does NOT silently succeed and leave a daemon
#      loop-dialing forever. The failure-path block runs FIRST so a
#      stale pid/status file from a real prior run cannot mask the
#      diagnostic.
#
#   2. `status` reports `connected` only when the bidi stream is
#      actually up — it reads the daemon's connection sentinel, not
#      just the pid file.
#
#   3. `stop` brings the daemon down cleanly (exit code 0) and the OS
#      process actually goes away — confirmed by polling the pid until
#      it is no longer alive.
#
# Prerequisites the operator must satisfy BEFORE running this script:
#
#   1. A running `rimsky-host-agent-proxy` reachable at $PROXY_ADDR.
#      For containerized deployments the operator boots
#      `rimsky-host-agent-proxy:latest` and exposes its gRPC port;
#      for local dev `RIMSKY_PROXY_BIN` can point at a freshly-built
#      binary which this script spawns directly. The driver test
#      under `test/scenarios/host_agent_control_plane_demo_test.go`
#      uses the binary path so the full flow runs in CI without
#      Docker.
#
#   2. The `rimsky` CLI binary on $PATH (or `RIMSKY_BIN` pointing at a
#      built binary). `make cli` builds it for bare-metal use.
#
# Output discipline: exits 0 only when all three properties were
# exhibited. Any deviation (a successful `start` against a bogus proxy,
# a `connected` report against a torn-down stream, a `stop` that fails
# to shut the process down) exits non-zero with a diagnostic.
